					<h2>Some information about myself</h2>
					<p> My name is Francisco Hernandez and I am a 26 year old graduate out of Florida International University.  I received my degree in Psychology in 2015.  Although, I have always taken an interest in computers from a young age.  That is why I am currently constructing my own personal website from scratch, without the use of a website builder.  As I do this I am learning HTML, CSS and Javascript as I go to give myself my very own hands-on approach.  Some tools and resources that I am using to make this happen are <span><a href="http://www.w3schools.com" style= "color: blue;">W3Schools</a></span>

		<h2>This is the beginning of something Wonderful</h2>
					<p id="Goals">I've begun on this project to showcase my knowledge on not only html but my increasing knowledge of CSS. The following is what I wish to accomplish in doing this website.
						<ul>
							<li>Actively building while learning to get the experience of making a website from scratch</li>
							<li>Trial and error in designing the website</li>
							<li>Finishing the website within 30 days</li>
						</ul>
